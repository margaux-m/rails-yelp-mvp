# Yelp MVP

Yelp MVP is a two-model Rails app - a clone of Yelp, with restaurants and reviews.

This MVP includes the following features:

- A visitor can see the list of all restaurants.
- A visitor can add a new restaurant, and be redirected to the show view of that new restaurant.
- A visitor can see the details of a restaurant, with all the reviews related to the restaurant.
- A visitor can add a new review to a restaurant.

Done during my time at Le Wagon.
